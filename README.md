# Portfolio Viewer for Employers

This homework assignment involves creating a simple portfolio viewer that allows employers to review a potential employee's work samples. The goal is to help employers assess the candidate's skills and suitability for a job position based on their previous work.

## Summary

The portfolio viewer accomplishes the following:

- The homepage showcases the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about the developer, their work, and contact information.

- Clicking on a navigation link smoothly scrolls the user interface (UI) to the corresponding section, making it easy to navigate the portfolio.

- The "Work" section displays titled images of the developer's applications. The first application's image is larger, making it stand out to employers.

- Clicking on an application image redirects employers to the deployed application, allowing them to explore the project in detail.

- The portfolio viewer features a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring a consistent user experience.

The portfolio viewer aims to provide employers with a user-friendly and accessible way to assess a potential employee's work samples. By presenting the candidate's portfolio in an organized and responsive manner, employers can gain valuable insights into their skills and evaluate their suitability for the job.
