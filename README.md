# JavaScript Password Generator

This homework assignment focuses on creating a password generator application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on their selected criteria. The application runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.

## Summary

The password generator application accomplishes the following:

- When the user clicks the "Generate Password" button, they are presented with a series of prompts to select password criteria.

- The prompts include options for the password length (between 8 and 128 characters) and the inclusion of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numeric characters, and special characters.

- The user's input is validated to ensure that at least one character type is selected and the chosen password length falls within the specified range.

- Once all prompts are answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.

- The generated password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page, providing the user with a strong and secure password.

By developing this password generator application, employees can conveniently generate random passwords that meet specific criteria. This helps enhance the security of sensitive data by creating strong passwords tailored to individual preferences. The application also provides a clean and responsive user interface, ensuring a seamless experience across different screen sizes.
